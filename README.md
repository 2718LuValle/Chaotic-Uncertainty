# Chaotic-Uncertainty
To use this you need to download the file "chaotic_uncertainty.pck" to your computer and use the source command in R (not R studio or an online version) to load it into R.
It is currently set up to use multiple processors in windows (I use a dell  machine with an I9 processor)
The commands are given in the file "Chaotic Uncertainty Extended and Annotated"
